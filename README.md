# UBC (BCS) Hacks 2024!

## Inspiration

As university students, we often face moments of frustration and confusion with homework questions or complex concepts. In such times, a study partner becomes invaluable, aiding us in navigating these challenging moments by collaborating on solutions and clarifying concepts. However, the absence of a centralized platform has led to a scattered search across various social media and platforms for study partners. By creating a dedicated platform for this purpose, we aim to streamline the process of finding a compatible study buddy, enhancing overall efficiency.

## What it does

bestBuddies(U &me) is a dynamic posting website where students can pose course-related questions, seek study partners, and make new friendships. Users can easily input their contact details, course code, and a brief description of their queries or needs. Additionally, the platform offers the flexibility to edit or delete posts after their initial submission. If students are specifically looking to find a study partner, they can effortlessly search through active posts filtered by course codes.

## How we built it

Our approach involved using Supabase for backend data management and React for frontend development. By integrating JavaScript and CSS, we successfully crafted a responsive and user-friendly live posting website, tailored to assist students in finding study buddies and seeking academic support.

## Challenges we ran into

At the start of the hackathon, our understanding of React and databases was limited. We encountered frustration when we couldn't fetch data from Supabase and display it in our app. However, we overcame this issue by thoroughly exploring Supabase documentation and researching through Google and ChatGPT.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

As pure beginners, we managed to learn everything necessary to build a full-stack CRUD web app by watching YouTube videos and by ChatGPT.

## What we learned

Teamwork and self-learninig skills

## What's next for bestBuddies(U &me)

We plan to enhance BestBuddies (U & Me) by adding new features. Specifically, we aim to improve the user interface for a better user experience. Additionally, we intend to implement user authentication functionality to ensure secure data modification by users.
